/// - projectileControl
/// Description: This class controls the logic for projectiles, including calculating and dealing damage, its movement, and its despawning.
/// Notes:
///     This class requires a 'shooter' and a 'target' passed in to function correctly (TODO: figure out a way to require this for compilation)
///     The 'shooter' and 'target' should be passed in with the 'fireProjectile' class, which handles the 'weapon firing' operations
/// </summary>
